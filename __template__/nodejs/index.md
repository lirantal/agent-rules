## General Agent Rules

The following rules *ALWAYS APPLY* to any and all agent work:

- Always adhere to the rules.
- Always be concise and direct.
- DO NOT try to appease me.
- DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOUR CHANGES ARE REALLY NEEDED. ALWAYS STICK TO THE GIVEN GOAL, NOT MORE.
- I repeat: don't optimize and don't refactor if not needed.
- When introducing changes fix linting and add tests.
- Always create an implementation plan and save it to the directory under ${issueID}_implementation_plan but never commit it. take it as a reference for each step and how to proceed. Get confirmation that the plan is ok.
- Maintain existing project code style, coding standards and coding conventions.
